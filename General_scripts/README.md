This folder contains functions coded to realise some analysis and some visualisation of the genomic data. 
The file called `Cline_functions.R` was published in [Le Moan et al, 2024](https://academic.oup.com/evlett/advance-article/doi/10.1093/evlett/qrae014/7656805) and the functions are taken from the hzar package [Derryberry et al, 2013](https://web.natur.cuni.cz/~muncling/HZAR.pdf). I simply re-organised the functions so they would fit my needs, but the source code is from this work.
