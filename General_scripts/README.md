This folder contains functions coded to realise some analysis and some visualisation of the genomic data. 
The file called `Cline_functions.R` was published in [Le Moan et al, 2024](https://academic.oup.com/evlett/advance-article/doi/10.1093/evlett/qrae014/7656805). I simply re-organised the functions so they would fit my needs, 
but the source code is from this work.
