## What is in the directory?

This directory contains the scripts used to run Fis analyses using RStan. The scripts were written by R. Butlin and the Rscript was modified to be used with the data we had.

## How to use these scripts?

To run the analyses, open [RStudio](https://www.posit.co) and execute it line by line.
