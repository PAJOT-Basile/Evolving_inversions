# Figures


## What is in the directory?

This directory contains the scripts used to produce all the figures that are in the paper. As these scripts use data produced by different analyses, it is best to run these codes once all the data was produced. In addition, some figures were modified (legend was moved or text was added) so the output of the figure might not match the one in the paper exactly.

## How to use these scripts?

To run the analyses, open [RStudio](https://www.posit.co) and execute the scripts line by line.


## What output to expect?

Most figures are saved automatically, but it is not the case for each script.
