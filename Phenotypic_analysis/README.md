# Phenotypic_analysis


## What is in the directory?

This directory contains the scripts used to run phenotypic analysis (variations in individual size or colour along the transects). The two scripts correspond to the two studied traits.

## How to use these scripts?

To run the analyses, open [RStudio](https://www.posit.co) and execute the scripts line by line.
